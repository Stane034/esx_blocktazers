# esx_blocktazers
A simple &amp; optimized ESX resource to stop modders tazing other players. This resource works as a whitelist, so any player with a job in the "allowedJobs" table, which is only police by default, is allowed to use tazers, otherwise, the player will be kicked with a custom kick message you can customize in the server.lua file. You can also find the "allowedJobs" table inside of the server.lua file which you can add and remove jobs from as you would like.

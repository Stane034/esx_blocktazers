# esx_blocktazers
A simple &amp; optimized ESX resource to stop modders tazing other players. This resource works as a whitelist, so any player with a job in the "allowedJobs" table, which is only police by default, is allowed to use tazers, otherwise, the player will be kicked with a custom kick message you can customize in the server.lua file.

# esx_blocktazers
A simple &amp; optimized ESX resource to prevent cheaters from tazing other players. This resource works as a whitelist, so any player with a job in the "whitelisted_jobs" table, which is only police by default, are allowed to use tazers/stun guns, otherwise, the player will be kicked with a custom kick message you can customize in the server.lua file. You can also find the "whitelisted_jobs" table inside of the server.lua file which you can add and remove jobs from as you would like.

Please Note: This resource requires OneSync to be enabled in order to function properly.
